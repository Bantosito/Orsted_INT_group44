This is a guide on how to use the program.


1. Make sure you have pandas and matplotlib libraries installed for python 3 
 (following commands are intended for use with "pip" package management system)

	pip install pandas
	pip install matplotlib

2.To run our code you must compile "Iterface.py" with Python 3.8.4+
   (May work with older versions of Python 3 too.)

Program looks for file: "Turbine_Latest.csv"

1. In the current version program automaticly drops rows containing no values
	-In the case of Turbine_Latest.csv last 14 rows
	
	-Program doesn't require modified file.

2.Turbine_Latest.csv file is not being modified at any time. All modifications are being saved in a file named "Turbine_Output.csv"
